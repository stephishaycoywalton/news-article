News Article Assignment

The aim of this project was to simply use HTML and Internal CSS to replicate the given article as closely as possible. The content was of polar bears, the text used was Lorem Ipsum, and the main CSS attributes used/practiced in this project is the "float" attribute. 

The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning).

I initially found this project to be difficult because I did not understand the concept of the element being taken out of natural flow and being positioned in contrast to the absolute positioning. After completing this assignment I thoroughly understand the process of purpose and use of the "float" attribute.
